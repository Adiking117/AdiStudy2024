Data encapsulation and Memory Optimization 

Example Problem Breakdown:
Class Layout and Memory Efficiency:

For a desktop application, where memory is more abundant, an Interval class may store minutes and seconds as separate long values (assuming each long is 8 bytes). This results in an object size of 16 bytes.
For a mobile application, where memory is more constrained, the Interval class might instead store only one long representing total time in seconds. This reduces the object size to 8 bytes by consolidating the data.
Encapsulation to Protect Data Members:

You avoid exposing the internal representation of time (either as separate minutes and seconds or as a single time value) directly. This way, if you decide to change how time is represented internally (for instance, switching between two long values or one long value), client code remains unaffected.
Using private fields and public accessor methods (like getMinutes(), getSeconds(), and getTime()) hides the internal details, allowing the internal representation to evolve without impacting the code that uses the class.
Why Use Private Variables and Encapsulation?
Encapsulation is fundamental for achieving flexibility, modularity, and protection:

Flexibility: If the class internals need to change (e.g., switching from minutes and seconds to a single time field), only the class’s internal methods (getMinutes(), getSeconds(), etc.) need updates. External code using these methods will continue to work seamlessly.
Modularity: By managing data in a centralized place (inside the class), you can ensure consistency in how time is represented and manipulated.
Protection: Encapsulation prevents other parts of the program from accidentally or intentionally altering the internal state in a way that might compromise the integrity of the object.

Example in C# with Encapsulation
public class Interval
{
    private long timeInSeconds;  // Internal representation in seconds

    // Constructor that initializes the interval with minutes and seconds
    public Interval(long minutes, long seconds)
    {
        timeInSeconds = (minutes * 60) + seconds;
    }

    // Public method to get minutes
    public long GetMinutes()
    {
        return timeInSeconds / 60;
    }

    // Public method to get seconds
    public long GetSeconds()
    {
        return timeInSeconds % 60;
    }

    // Public method to get the total time in seconds
    public long GetTime()
    {
        return timeInSeconds;
    }
}

Explanation of the Code:

Encapsulation of Internal Representation:
Internal Representation (timeInSeconds) , This single long stores time in seconds, suitable for memory-constrained environments.
timeInSeconds is a private field that stores the total time in seconds. This is an efficient way to represent the interval and conserves memory, especially useful for mobile or memory-limited environments.

Constructor Initialization:
The constructor accepts minutes and seconds as parameters and converts them to seconds to store in timeInSeconds.
Accessor Methods (GetMinutes, GetSeconds, GetTime):
GetMinutes() computes the minute portion by dividing timeInSeconds by 60.
GetSeconds() calculates the remaining seconds after accounting for full minutes.
GetTime() returns the total time in seconds.
Accessor Methods (getMinutes(), getSeconds(), getTime()): These methods derive the required values based on timeInSeconds. This way, if timeInSeconds changes in the future, only these methods need updating.


Benefits:
Internal Representation Flexibility: By storing timeInSeconds privately, you can change the internal data representation without altering how the class is used externally.
Memory Efficiency: Using a single long field reduces memory usage to 8 bytes (for the timeInSeconds field) instead of 16 bytes for separate minute and second fields.
Uniform Interface: Client code uses getMinutes(), getSeconds(), and getTime() methods regardless of how time is stored, so any future change in internal representation doesn’t affect external code.
Memory Optimization: By using a single field for timeInSeconds, memory usage is minimized while preserving the same functionality.
Encapsulation: The private timeInSeconds field prevents direct access, making sure only controlled operations through accessor methods interact with the data. The private field ensures the internal state is protected and accessed only through controlled methods.

Example Usage:
class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Interval interval = new Interval(5, 30);  // 5 minutes and 30 seconds

        Console.WriteLine("Minutes: " + interval.GetMinutes());   // Output: 5
        Console.WriteLine("Seconds: " + interval.GetSeconds());   // Output: 30
        Console.WriteLine("Total Time in Seconds: " + interval.GetTime()); // Output: 330
    }
}

When Internal Representation Changes:
If the Interval class's internals are updated in the future (say, for a different calculation or more precision), only the private members and methods need adjusting, while external code remains unchanged. This is the essence of data encapsulation and is especially helpful for code that must adapt to different platforms with varied resource constraints.
